Passionate about computers and cybersecurity.

## My playground
- Alternating in a red-team team: I create scenarios and participate in the training of social teams.
- HackTheBox: to push my limits and train myself.

- Languages & scripting: Python, a bit of C++ ...
- Tools & methods: penetration tests, post-operation, automation, flow observation, detection, reaction.
- Soft skills: curiosity, analytical spirit, taste for documentation, continuous learning.

## What motivates
- Understand the systems, their mechanisms and how to bypass their security. 
- Working with people: whether for a red/blue exercise, a sharing of tools, knowledge sharing.

## Outside the cyber
When I am not in front of a terminal, I like:
- explore new environments (virtual or real)
- exchange with enthusiasts
- keep myself updated on the new techs, trends & tools that are moving the field.
